Task 1: Complete 
Task 2: Complete 
Task 3: Complete 

I modified the resident raver template level to complete the hackathon tasks.

Once you come to the first cliff you will find two pits, one of acid and one fire. 

The acid kills only zombies, and the fire kills all

There is a trigger in between the pits that spawns zombies to drop from the ceiling into both pits to show they kill the zombies.

There are also suicide zombies randomly spawning before the first cliff, that walk off into the acid.

Press tab twice to use the NUCLEAR MISSLE weapon, which shoots forward like the gun and explodes like the grenade!
